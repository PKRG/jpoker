jpoker : javascript online poker client

What is it ?

http://jspoker.pokersource.info/jpoker/ is a javascript client for
playing online poker. It displays the list of poker tables and when
the user choses one, it is displayed in the browser. The user can
join the game and play hands. It supports multi table
tournaments. The poker server to which jpoker connects must implement
a protocol compatible with
http://pokersource.info/poker-network/. The jpoker user interface is
based on http://tiddlywiki.com/. However the underlying
http://jquery.com/ based library is independent and can be used to
implement an alternate look and feel.
