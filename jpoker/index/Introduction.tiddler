Although poker-network is known to be able to serve 4,000 simultaneous players with very little resources (http://pokersource.info/stress-test/2007-08/), the pokersource.eu poker room will always be limited to a maximum of 500 simultaneous players.  The most compeling reason is that even the most talented room manager can't personaly watch over a thousand players: 500 is probably the best he can do. 

The pokersource.eu poker room will never provide real money tables. The only poker chips allowed at the tables are those obeying the currency protocol implemented by poker-network. There will be no interface for credit cards.

All the software and the graphics used at http://pokersource.eu/ are and will be Free Software.
